These files comtain the R scripts of the major Mendelian randomization analyses in our paper: The causal role of accelerometer-derived sleep traits on glycated haemoglobin: a Mendelian randomization study.
The "1SMR" directory contains:
1) 1SMR-2SLS: A main analysis in one-sample Mendelian randomization (1SMR) with two-stage least squares (2SLS) instrumental variable analyses applied to the UK Biobank (UKB) 
2) 1SMR-CC: Sensitivity analyses with collider-correction methods in 1SMR design applying to the UKB
3) A functional file "ExtractQ" related to the collider-correction method developed by Prof. Jack Bowden

The "2SMR" directory contains:
1) The two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR) analyses appling to the UKB (2SMR-UKB)
2) The 2SMR analyses applying to the MAGIC (2SMR-MAGIC)

The "MVMR" directory contains:
1) The multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analysis in 1SMR design applying to the UKB (MVMR-1SMR)
2) The MVMR analysis in 2SMR design applying to the UKB (MVMR-2SMR-UKB)
3) The MVMR analysis in 2SMR design appyling to the MAGIC (MVMR-2SMR-MAGIC)

The Linux codes related to the cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) are not provided, which can be found in https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Heritability-and-Genetic-Correlation.
